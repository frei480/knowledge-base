**Cohesion** and **Coupling** are fundamental concepts in software design, measuring different aspects of code quality. They are inversely related: **high cohesion often enables low coupling**, leading to more maintainable, flexible, and robust systems. Here's a breakdown:

### 🔷 **Cohesion**  
**Definition**: How closely related the responsibilities of a single module/component (e.g., a class, function, or module) are.  
**Goal**: **High Cohesion** (a component does one well-defined thing).  

| **Levels**              | Description                                                                 | Example                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **High (Good)**         | All elements work toward a single, focused task.                            | `EmailValidator` class only checks email format. |
| **Low (Bad)**           | Elements have unrelated responsibilities.                                   | `Utils` class handling dates, file I/O, and math. |

**Why High Cohesion?**  
- ✅ Easier to understand, test, and reuse.  
- ✅ Changes are localized.  
- ✅ Reduces side effects.

### 🔗 **Coupling**  
**Definition**: The degree of interdependence between modules/components.  
**Goal**: **Low (Loose) Coupling** (minimize dependencies between components).  

| **Levels**              | Description                                                                 | Example                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Low (Good)**          | Components interact through well-defined interfaces (e.g., APIs, events).   | Class A uses interface `IStorage`; Class B implements it. |
| **High (Bad)**          | Components rely on internal details of others.                              | Class A directly modifies Class B’s private fields. |

**Why Low Coupling?**  
- ✅ Changes in one component rarely break others.  
- ✅ Easier to replace or update components.  
- ✅ Promotes modularity and parallel development.

### **Key Differences**  
| Aspect          | **Cohesion**                            | **Coupling**                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**       | Internal unity of a **single** module.   | Interdependencies **between** modules.     |
| **Goal**        | **High**: One clear purpose per module.  | **Low**: Minimal reliance on other modules. |
| **Analogy**     | A well-organized toolbox (all wrenches together). | Tools work via standard sockets (no custom adapters). |

---

### **Relationship & Trade-offs**  
- **High cohesion promotes low coupling**: A focused component needs fewer external dependencies.  
- **Low coupling supports high cohesion**: Isolated components can refine their purpose independently.  
- **Balance**: Over-isolating components can increase complexity (e.g., microservices overkill).

### **Examples**  
#### Low Cohesion / High Coupling (❌ Bad):  
```java
class Processor {
  void processData() { 
    // Reads file
    // Validates data
    // Saves to database
  }
}
// ❌ Does everything + tightly coupled to file system/database.
```

#### High Cohesion / Low Coupling (✅ Good):  
```java
// High cohesion: Each class has one responsibility.
class FileReader { String readFile() { ... } }
class DataValidator { boolean isValid(String data) { ... } }

// Low coupling: Inject dependencies via interfaces.
class DatabaseSaver {
  private final DbConnection db;
  DatabaseSaver(DbConnection db) { this.db = db; } // Dependency injection
}
```

### **Key Takeaway**  
> **"Strive for modules that do one thing well (high cohesion) and communicate minimally via contracts (low coupling)."**  
This approach makes systems easier to debug, scale, and maintain. Tools like **dependency injection**, **interfaces**, and **design patterns** (e.g., Observer, Facade) help achieve this balance.
